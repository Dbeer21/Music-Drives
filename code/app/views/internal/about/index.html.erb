<p>"Music Drives" will attempt to address issues of poverty and the disappearance of the arts from public schools. Some families do not have the proper income to set aside money to purchase a musical instrument for their child. Also, many under-funded music programs at local public schools lack the instrumentation needed to give students a worthwhile and meaningful musical education. All the while, many Americans have musical instruments lying around their homes that they never touch. These instruments would be much better put to use at the hands of an eager child who wants to learn how to play music, but does not have the money or resources. Music can be a catalyst for humans as a way to bolster their creativity and exercise their minds in new ways so that they can apply this new work ethic and intelligence in other ways to better themselves.</p>
